    "# minGemma\n",
    "\n",
    "our goal here is to teach all of the architectural concepts used in [Google's Gemma](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/gemma-report.pdf). The code here is a frankensteinian mixture between a little bit of [Andrej Karpathy's minGPT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=5012s) and mostly [Google's pytorch implementation of Gemma](https://github.com/google/gemma_pytorch). As such, certain aspects of the Gemma model will or won't be included based on our learning goals, which are to understand the architecture rather than the tokenizer, data cleaning, and distributed training techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Included:\n",
    "- RoPE\n",
    "- RMSnorm\n",
    "- GeGLU activation\n",
    "- Multi-Query Attention (only found in the smaller model)\n",
    "- The extra normalization in the middle of each layer, between the attention mechanism and the MLP\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Not Included: \n",
    "- **Gemma's training dataset:** The dataset & corresponding RLHF framework used to train Gemmma is out-of-scope for this lesson. This is unfortunate since a big part of Gemma's impressive performance is attributed to their high quantity and quality of data. I recommend reading the technical report for more information\n",
    "- **Tokenization training:** The full 256,128 token vocabulary of Gemma is unusually large even for models orders of magnitude larger than Gemma (if I remember correctly, Llama's is around 32k). Their tokenizer also has interesting qualities such as beginning-of-sentence & end-of-sentence tokens & other tokens related to instruct tuning. The issue with training such a large token vocabulary is that many tokens are likely to rarely/never be trained, thus meaning you've wasted compute and leaving yourself vulnerable to the [SolidGoldMagikarp problem](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation) unless you use an absurdly large dataset size like they did (2T and 6T tokens for the 2b and 7b models respectively). That being said, a better lesson than mine would've taught you how to train a more reasonably sized vocabulary. Instead of doing that, I recommend for homework you check out [Andrej Karpathy's recent guide on building tokenizers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) and implement a reasonably sized one yourself. Instead of that, we'll be using simple character-wise tokenization of TinyShakespeare by default, but the code will include the option to use Gemma's original gigantic tokenizer just so you can see what it looks like.\n",
    "- **Highly parallelized training:** This is something I don't believe google included in their open-sourcing of these models which is unfortunate, but reasonable given that they trained on TPUs and no one owns TPUs except google. Rather, their open-sourced code (at least the pytorch version) is designed strictly for inference with their open-sourced weights. I recommend looking elsewhere if you want to learn about parallelized training techniques like sharding on GPUs\n",
    "- **KV caching:** A standard method for saving on compute in transformers, KV caching involves saving individual key and value vectors calculated at each step of inference for use at future steps of inference. I've not included it here because it's an inference-specific mechanism whereas this code is meant to train, but if you develop your own inference version of this code then you 100% need to re-implment KV caching\n",
    "- **Quantization:** This shouldn't be necessary for the absolutely tiny size of the default parameters I've set for minGemma\n",
    "- **Batched Inference:** The open-sourced pytorch code for Gemma is setup to efficiently handle batched decoding of variable context lengths. The implementation here is only designed to perform inference on a single prompt at a time, which is all we really need for learning about the gemma architecture; i would hope no one is using this code for deployment.\n",
    "- **Embedding Bias:** There was an odd reference to a bias term for use in the output layer after multiplying by the transpose of the embedding matrix. It was labeled as optional and didn't get used in google's own pytorch implementation so i assume it's inclusion was an accident, but it may have been utilized in different instantiations of the model. My interpretation of this idea is that some tokens are always more or less likely than others, which a bias term could capture. If anyone knows feel free to reach out or push an update to the repo\n",
    "\n",
    "### ToDo\n",
    "- see if i can remove typing from the attention softmax calculation\n",
    "- clean everything up"

Tokenization is an often underlooked part of the LLM design process, and I suggest you check out the [recent video by Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) that goes in-depth on how to make your own tokenizer. Think of it as a homework assignment to:\n",

The latter is just copy & pasted from [Google's own Gemma pytorch repo](https://github.com/google/gemma_pytorch). Again we will not be delving into the full details of their tokenizer; rather, just take a look after you watch the video by Andrej and see what you can learn. It seems google built Gemma's tokenizer on top of SentencePiece and included extra special characters for the beginning of a sentence, end of a sentence, and a padding token that's built to just fill in empty-space for sequences that aren't as long as the model's full context length.

    "# Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemma uses RoPE, which is a popular relative positional encoding scheme. Positional encodings are designed to help the model understand the order of tokens in the text since transformers don't have a built-in ordering to them when reading a sequence. Instead of telling Gemma the precise location of each token (which would be \"absolute\" positional encoding), relative positional encodings only reveal to Gemma the placement of different tokens relative to each other. RoPE is a relative positional encoding scheme that functions by multiplying against query & key matrices in the attention mechanism (rather than, for example, addition along the token embeddings) and uses trigonometric functions to effecitvely \"rotate\" the matrices used in self-attention. RoPE is the standard-to-beat nowadays as it's also find in other notable open-source models like Llama. \n",
    "\n",
    "The essential idea is that any given vector within the query & key matrices has a location $m$ and $n$ respectively. Remember a given vector within a query or key matrix corresponds to a specific token in the sequence. You multiply the rotary matrix corresponding to that position against each the query & key, and then when you further multiply those together you effectively have a comparison that takes into account how far away the two tokens are. \n",

The thesis of RMSnorm is essentially that scaling the variance is the thing that's actually helpful, and centering the mean is not so useful, therefore it makes sense for efficiency's sake to just not set the mean to 0. I'd also like to point out that RMSnorm places the vector onto a hypersphere (a sphere but with many more than 3 dimensions) with radius $\\sqrt{n}$. This doesn't really matter here, but it's important for other projects I plan to release in the coming months.\n",
