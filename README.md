# minGemma

a fairly minimal implementation of [Google's Gemma model](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/gemma-report.pdf) meant to be used as a teaching resource. The idea is for it to teach you the newer state-of-the-art methods that have come out after what was discussed in [Andrej Karpathy's minGPT lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=5013). You can treat Andrej's video as a necessary prereq. Here's my youtube video walking through the notebook:

Potential ToDo's:
- make it possible to download Gemma 2b and perform inference on it within this notebook
- be more detailed with the RoPE comments
- turn it into runnable .py files
